# Working with SQLite databases

_COMP0034 2023-24 Week 2 coding activities_

## 1. Preparation and introduction

This assumes you have already forked the coursework repository and cloned the resulting repository to your IDE.

1. Create and activate a virtual environment
2. Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the app `flask --app paralympics run --debug`
4. Open a browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
5. Try it again with http://127.0.0.1:5000/name (replace name with your name)
6. You should see the variable route for the homepage (the final activity from last week)
7. Stop the app using `CTRL+C`

Consider installing the VS Code extension SQLite Viewer to allow you to view the content of a database through the VS
Code interface.

If you are using PyCharm Professional then you can already view database files. You cannot do this in PyCharm Community
edition which is why Professional is recommended.

When you install from requirements.txt this
included [Flask-SQLAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/quickstart/). The SQLAlchemy package
will also be installed as it is a dependency for Flask-SQLAlchemy. Together they provide functionality that lets you
more easily create Python classes that map to database tables; and handles the database interaction, i.e. SQL queries,
using Python functions. This follows a design pattern called ORM, Object Relational Mapper. An ORM encapsulates, or
wraps, data stored in a database into an object that can be used in Python.

Flask-SQLAlchemy works with many database formats but will not work directly with .csv/.xlsx file. You will use SQLite
which stores the tables and data in a single file which is convenient for the coursework.

There are various ways to save csv as sqlite. The following uses libraries you should be familiar with from COMP0035,
namely pandas and pathlib; and introduces some SQLAlchemy code.

## Step 1: Change the Flask app to be created using the Flask application factory pattern

You will create a function that allows you to create a Flask app and then enable that app to use extensions such as
Flask-SQLAlchemy and to add configuration parameters.

This is an [application factory](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/patterns/appfactories/) pattern. Like a
factory production line, you create the app, then you pass it along a production line
adding extra features to it as needed.

1. Open `paralympics/__init__.py`
2. The following is based on the `create_app()` function from
   the [Flask tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/tutorial/factory/):
    ```python
    import os

    from flask import Flask


    def create_app(test_config=None):
        # create the Flask app
        app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)
        # configure the Flask app (see later notes on how to generate your own SECRET_KEY)
        app.config.from_mapping(
            SECRET_KEY='dev',
            # Set the location of the database file called paralympics.sqlite which will be in the app's instance folder
            SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI= "sqlite:///" + os.path.join(app.instance_path, 'paralympics.sqlite'),  
        )

        if test_config is None:
            # load the instance config, if it exists, when not testing
            app.config.from_pyfile('config.py', silent=True)
        else:
            # load the test config if passed in
            app.config.from_mapping(test_config)

        # ensure the instance folder exists
        try:
            os.makedirs(app.instance_path)
        except OSError:
            pass

        return app
    ```
3. Create your own unique `SECRET_KEY`.

   `SECRET_KEY` is used by Flask and extensions to keep data safe. Itâ€™s set to 'dev' to provide a convenient value
   during development, but it should be overridden with a random value when deploying.

   `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` is the path where the SQLite database file will be saved. It's under app.instance_path,
   which is the path that Flask has chosen for the instance folder.

   You can generate a secret key from the Terminal command line. Type `python3` or `python` and press enter. At
   the `>>>` prompt type `import secrets` and press enter. Then type `secrets.token_urlsafe(16)` and press enter. You
   should see a string of 16 characters. Copy this and use it to replace the word 'dev' in
   the SECRET_KEY line in the `create_app()` function.

   ![Create a SECRET_KEY](assets/secret_key.png)
4. Now that the app is created in the `create_ap()` function, you need to modify `paralympics.py` app to use this.

   Use the Flask `current_app` object to access the configured app.

   Replace the contents on `paralympics.py` with the following:

    ```python
   from flask import current_app as app
 
 
   @app.route('/')
   def hello():
      return f"Hello!"
   ```
5. Return to the `create_app()` function and now let the app know about the routes that are defined in `paralympics.py`.

   ```python
   # Put the following code inside the create_app function after the code to ensure the instance folder exists
   # This lis likely to be circa line 40.
   with app.app_context():
       # Register the routes with the app in the context
       from paralympics import paralympics
   ```

   NB: Consider renaming `paralympics.py` to ``routes.py or `controllers.py` to avoid confusion between the
   paralympics package and the paralympics module within that package.

6. Check that you can run the app `flask --app paralympics run --debug`. Flask recognises the `create_app()` function.

## Initialise the SQLAlchemy extension

Return to `__init__.py` and add the following code to _before_ the `create_app()` function to initialise the SQLAlchemy
object.

```python
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase


class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass


db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)
```

## Define a model

Create a python file called `models.py`. This will contain classes that map to your database tables. Create a python
file. This is often named `models.py` but doesn't have to be.

The syntax for a class that maps to a database table is given in
the [Flask-SQLAlchemy documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/patterns/sqlalchemy/#flask-sqlalchemy-extension)
. The table is defined as follows:

- Define the class with an appropriate name.
- The tablename should match the tablename in the database.
- The column names should match the column names used in the database.
- The column datatypes should match the data types used in the database.
- The classes inherit the Flask-SQLAlchemy Model class. This automatically gives the class access to functions that will
  handle the constructor so you don't need to define it. You can access the instance of SQLAlchemy, called `db`, that
  you just created in `__init__.py`.

At some point the paralympics app will have authentication and so needs a table to hold user details. Add the following
class to `models.py`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column
from paralympics import db


class User(db.Model):
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, unique=True, nullable=False)
    password: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, unique=True, nullable=False)
```

Add the following code to create two classes that represents the data in the databas, Region and Event.

```python
# Adapted from https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/quickstart/#define-models
from sqlalchemy import Integer, String, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column, relationship
from paralympics import db


# This uses the latest syntax for SQLAlchemy, older tutorials will show different syntax
# SQLAlchemy provide an __init__ method for each model, so you do not need to declare this in your code
class Region(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "region"
    NOC: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, primary_key=True)
    region: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    notes: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    events: Mapped[list["Event"]] = relationship(back_populates="region")


class Event(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "event"
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    type: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    year: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, nullable=False)
    country: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    host: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=False)
    NOC: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("region.NOC"))
    region: Mapped[Region] = relationship("Region", back_populates="events")
    start: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    end: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    duration: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
    disabilities_included: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    countries: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=True)
    events: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
    athletes: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
    sports: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
    participants_m: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
    participants_f: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
    participants: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, nullable=True)
    highlights: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, nullable=True)


class User(db.Model):
    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    email: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, unique=True, nullable=False)
    password: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(db.Text, unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __init__(self, email: str, password: str):
        """
        Create a new User object using hashing the plain text password.
        :type password_string: str
        :type email: str
        :returns None
        """
        self.email = email
        self.password = password
```

The relationship between the two tables is defined used the primary and foreign keys with the `relationship` function
as follows:

```python

# non-Key/relationship column details have been omitted from the classes below for brevity
# one-to-many relationship from Region to Event https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/basic_relationships.html

class Region(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "region"
    # Primary key attribute
    NOC = db.Column(db.Text, primary_key=True)
    # add a relationship to Event. The Region then has a record of the Events associated with it.
    events = db.relationship("Event", back_populates="region")


class Event(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "event"
    # ForeignKey attribute. The ForeignKey is linked to the Region primary key using mapped_column(String, ForeignKey())
    NOC: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("region.NOC"))
    # add relationship to Region. The Event then has a record of the parent Region associated with the Event. 
    region: Mapped[Region] = relationship("Region", back_populates="events")  
```

## Update the `create_app()` function to generate the database tables

Add a line of code to the __init__.py in the paralympic_app package to import the models. To avoid circular
imports, put this after the app is created; so NOT at the top of the file where you would usually place
imports.

If you are using a linter you will need to ignore the warnings about placing the import at the top of the file.

To create the tables for User, Region and Event in the database use a Flask-SQLAlchemy function `db.create_all()`. This
will create the tables if they do not already exist. Add this line _after_ importing the models.

```python

def create_app(test_config=None):
    app = Flask(__name__, instance_relative_config=True)
    app.config.from_mapping(
        SECRET_KEY='l-tirPCf1S44mWAGoWqWlA',
        SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="sqlite:///" + os.path.join(app.instance_path, 'paralympics.sqlite'),
    )

    if test_config is None:
        app.config.from_pyfile('config.py', silent=True)
    else:
        app.config.from_mapping(test_config)

    try:
        os.makedirs(app.instance_path)
    except OSError:
        pass

    # Initialise Flask with the SQLAlchemy database extension
    db.init_app(app)

    # Models are defined in the models module, so you must import them before calling create_all, otherwise SQLAlchemy
    # will not know about them.
    from paralympics.models import User, Region, Event
    # Create the tables in the database
    # create_all does not update tables if they are already in the database.
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()

        # Register the routes with the app in the context
        from paralympics import paralympics

    return app
```

## Run  the app to generate the database

Run the app `flask --app paralympics run --debug`.

As the database does not exist it will be created. You can check this by looking in the instance folder. You should see
a file called `paralympics.sqlite`.

## Add data to the database

There are many ways to add data to a database using Python. This method assumes you created database as above and are
then going to add the data to the existing tables using Pandas DataFrame as you are already familiar with this from
COMP0035.

The basic workflow is:

1. Create a SQLite database engine that connects to the database file
2. Create a cursor object that can execute SQL queries
3. Read the .csv or .xlsx into a pandas DataFrame
4. Save the pandas DataFrame to the database tables
5. Close the database connection

The code to do this is in `data/add_data.py`.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # 1. Create a SQLite database engine that connects to the database file
    db_file = Path(__file__).parent.parent.joinpath("instance", "paralympics.sqlite")
    connection = sqlite3.connect(db_file)

    # 2. Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # 3. Read the .csv or .xlsx files into pandas DataFrames

    # Read the noc_regions data to a pandas dataframe
    # Additional string to read "" as a null value https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html
    na_values = ["", ]
    noc_file = Path(__file__).parent.parent.joinpath("data", "noc_regions.csv")
    noc_regions = pd.read_csv(noc_file, keep_default_na=False, na_values=na_values)

    # Read the paralympics event data to a pandas dataframe
    event_file = Path(__file__).parent.parent.joinpath("data", "paralympic_events.csv")
    paralympics = pd.read_csv(event_file)

    # 4. Write the data from the pandas DataFrame to the database tables

    # if_exists="replace" If there is data in the table, replace it
    #  index=False Do not write the pandas index column to the database table
    noc_regions.to_sql("region", connection, if_exists="replace", index=False)
    paralympics.to_sql("event", connection, if_exists="replace", index=False)

    # 5. Close the database connection
    connection.close()
```

There is a second Python file that also creates the database tables, `create_db_add_data`. You do not need this for this
activity, it is included in case you want to take this approach for your coursework. The modified workflow for this is:

1. Create a SQLite database engine that connects to the database file
2. Create a cursor object that can execute SQL queries
3. Define the tables using SQL
4. Execute the SQL queries to create the tables
5. Commit the changes to the database (this saves the tables created in the previous step)
6. Read the .csv or .xlsx files into pandas DataFrames
7. Write the pandas DataFrame contents to the database tables
8. Close the database connection

## Reading

There are many aspects not covered in this tutorial that you could investigate.

- Track database changes: If you change a model's columns, use a migration library like Alembic
  with [Flask-Alembic](https://flask-alembic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or
  [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to generate migrations that update the database
  schema.
- Alternative Python class definitions using [Python Dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)
  with [SQLAlchemy `MappedAsDataclass`](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/models/#initializing-the-base-class))
- [Reflecting tables](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/models/#reflecting-tables) can be used if
  you have a database with the data in.
